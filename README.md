#k_means
k_means.py contains a simple example of using scikit-learn KMeans model to predict cluster assignments.
We first generate some random data from normal distributions, and then use k-means to predict the distribution it comes from. Because k-means makes 'hard' cluster assignments, it makes a few mistakes around where the two clusters meet and on the outliers.
